# UC Website

This project is a requirement in our CC14 - Web Application Development Course. It is a Bootstrap remake of our [school's website](https://uc-bcf.edu.ph/).

# Contributing

This project uses Bootstrap 5.1.3.

For more info on Bootstrap, visit the official [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/).

Some reusable components are provided as snippets in the [project's wiki](https://github.com/SaiKiru/cc14-uc-website/wiki).

The things to be done are in the repository's [Projects tab](https://github.com/users/SaiKiru/projects/1).

For questions, you may [open an issue](https://github.com/SaiKiru/cc14-uc-website/issues/new).

# Github Pages

Due to the way Github Pages work, root relative links `/../.../..` do not work correctly. All root relative links have been prepended with `/cc14-uc-website`.

Before deploying to another server, replace all `"/cc14-uc-website/` to `"/`
