    <h2>Health</h2>
    <p style="font: sans-serif; font-size: large;">
      Health is wealth. Thus, a healthy community is a wealthy community. UC nurtures this concept by conducting
      activities related to the alleviation of health-related problems in the community. Issues on family planning,
      hygiene, nutrition, medical attention and interventions are the main concern in the programs planned in this area.
      Medical mission that included projects such as "Operation Tuli", bloodletting, dental services, medical
      consultations and distribution of medicines were the highlights on health.
    </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p style="font: sans-serif; font-size: large;">
      As Dr. Jose P. Rizal puts it, "the youth is the hope of our fatherland and education is the key." Clearly
      expressed in his work entitled "Instruction", for Rizal, the mission of education is to elevate the country to the
      highest seat of glory and develop the people's mentality. Since education is the foundation of society and a
      prerequisite for social progress, Rizal claimed that only through education could the country be saved from
      domination and oppression.

      Last August 13 marked a significant event for this area when DepEd-Baguio through their Alternative Learning
      System (ALS) signified their support in providing life skills to our Out-of-School youths. This project espoused
      life-changing skills training programs by implementing the "Sagip-kabataan Project" now given a bigger and wider
      circle of influence by improving the concept to "Sagip-Kailyan".
    </p>

    <h2>Livelihood</h2>
    <p style="font: sans-serif; font-size: large;">
      After equipping with life skills and productive know-how, UC cannot and will not stop there. This area will
      facilitate employment, implementation of the skills learned, and aiding the community to establish livelihood
      programs.
    </p>

    <h2>Environment</h2>
    <p style="font: sans-serif; font-size: large;">
      Recent anguish caused by the whips of nature thru typhoons "Ondoy" and "Pepeng" reiterated the need to nurture and
      care for the environment. Eradicating environmental hazard, re-greening our planet, recycling, practicing proper
      waste disposal among others are just but few of the intervention programs that the UC community has been
      practicing for years. Known as the cleanest university in the city, UC feels more obliged than ever to share this
      legacy and continue the tradition.
    </p>

    <h2>Nurturance</h2>
    <p style="font: sans-serif; font-size: large;">

      Caring for the well-being of the community is the holistic approach to social responsibility. This area has been
      providing the material needs of our less fortunate communities. Material sustenance included relief goods,
      construction materials, school supplies, computer units, arm chairs for the schools, etc. Though initially
      sustaining the delivery of these material goods to the community, this area bespeaks of what social responsibility
      is all about, embracing all areas, nurturing the community and the environment is the end goal of this office.

      <h2>Adopt-A-School Program</h2>
      <p style="font: sans-serif; font-size: large;">
        On May 5, 2021,UC imparted genuine hopes to thirty (30) indigent pupils of Camp 7 Elementary School who were
        sponsored under the Adopt-A-Scholar Program of the University thru the distribution of Care-Hygiene Packs worth
        of Php30, 000.
