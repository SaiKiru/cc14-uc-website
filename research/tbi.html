          <h2>Background</h2>

          <p>The Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD) and
            the University of the Philippines, through the National Engineering Center, launched the Higher Education
            Institution Readiness for Innovation and Technopreneurship (HeIRIT) Program, a 12-month preparatory program
            for starting technology business incubators (TBIs).</p>

          <p>The HeIRIT Program was designed in order to help universities meet the requirements of the Council's TBI
            funding and train their managers to run their own DOST-affiliated TBIs to cater the growing demand for early
            stage entrepreneurial support particularly in the regions. The kick-off activity took place on April 16-18,
            2018 at the UP National Engineering Center was participated by different university TBI representatives. 20
            out of the 45 universities that applied around the country were successfully selected by the Council's Panel
            of Experts to undergo the said program. University of the Cordilleras is among those granted to establish a
            TBI.</p>

          <p>On May 3, 2019, University of the Cordilleras Innovation And Nurturing Space (UCIANS) had its soft
            launching at the University of the Cordilleras Legarda Campus. DOST Secretary Fortunato T. De La Peña
            together with other DOST national and regional officials graced the occasion. UC officials were led by Mr.
            Jesus Benjamin D. Salvosa, the chairman of the board of trustees and Mr. Ray Dean D. Salvosa, University
            president.</p>

          <p>UCIANS TBI is located at the University of the Cordilleras &#8212; Legarda Campus. The space includes (1)
            event area, (1) meeting/ideation space, and (1) workstation with (6) computer terminals. Currently these
            spaces are already in place and working as renovations for the additional conference room and workstation
            are already complete.</p>

          <p>As regards furniture, the center is fully furnished with amenities and equipment for it to operate.
            Furthermore, the network infrastructure of the center is up and running.</p>

          <p>Currently, the center has 4 active startup incubatee's from both Batch 1 and 2 that are undergoing the
            incubation program, 7 startup graduates from both Batch 1 and Batch 2, and 12 startup incubatees that are
            currently undergoing the pre-incubation program and set to onboard the main incubation program by June 2021.
            We plan to help our University create and implement new innovative ideas that generate value for public use.
          </p>

          <p>The goal of the DOST is to establish 1000 startups in the next five years through replication of startup
            communities in the regions. The UCIANS plan to enable our faculty and students to contribute as much as
            possible to attain this goal.</p>
