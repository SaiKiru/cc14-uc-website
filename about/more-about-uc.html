              <h2>Autonomous & Accredited</h2>
              <p style="font: sans-serif; font-size: 19px;">
                On June 10, 2010, the University of the Cordilleras was conferred the "Autonomus Status" by the
                Commission on Higher Education (CHED), after being issued the "Award of Distinction" certificate by the
                CHED Chairman himself, Emmanuel Y. Angeles. The certificate cited UC's exemplary performance in the
                trilogy functions of higher education, namely: instruction, research in public service, and in
                recognition of the outstanding performance of its graduates; which manifest UC's genuine commitment to
                quality excellence and global competitiveness.
                <br>
                <br>
                This distinction came after UC's assessment and affirmation of quality standards through CHED's
                "Institutional Quality Assurance through Monitoring and Evaluation (IQuAME)" during a visit by CHED's
                respected panels of experts and assessors from different institutions and regions on May 16, 2010. The
                3-day visit, highlighted with interviews and ocular inspection, provided for the panel, evidences of
                substantive and significant adherence to the following quality assurance areas: Governance and
                Management, Quality of Teaching and Research, Support for Students, Relations with the Community, and
                Management of Resources. Whereupon, the CHED Commissioners, in an en banc session on May 26, 2010,
                certified and approved the panel's final report recommendation, that UC have complied with all quality
                standards corresponding to "Category A(teaching)", or as a "Teaching University". UC is so far the only
                Higher Educational Institution in the Cordillera Administration Region (CAR) to achieve this highest
                level of categorization through an institutional accreditation. This certification and the awarding of
                Autonomous Status is a manifestation of UC's policy to deliberately seek external scrutiny, as an engine
                for assuring continuous institutional self-improvement.

              <p style="font: sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The rice terraces, often called the eighth wonder of the
                world, is a symbol of the genius of our race. They show the industry, patience and skill of the early
                Filipinos in this part of the highlands where UC is situated.
                <br>
                <br>
                The leaves of the pine tree, an evergreen, denote youth and its fresh and courageous outlook.
                <br>
                <br>
                The torch, the classical symbol of learning, means that while UC is dedicated to the cultivation of a
                distinct Filipino culture, it has profited from the teachings of other cultures.
                <br>
                <br>
                The shield implies that education, the birthright of everyone, is a protection against the inadequacy,
                intolerance, and slavery of the mind.

Hold high the torch;
Let its blaze reach all corners,
Throughout the world
to lighten the course of darkness.
Keep wise and well not forgetting fidelity,
To our Alma Mater, wherever we may be
Keep our hearts together with glowing
love and loyalty.
Hold tight the shield,
And defend our dear country
We must not yield
To threats made upon our safety.
This is the pledge
We shall keep till our dying day.
To our Alma Mater, wherever we may be
Keep our hearts together
With glowing love and loyalty.

Up the zigzag road, you will find your way
Leading to the gate of learning,
Give the place some thought, you can't go astray
There is where you'll hear them singing
*** Neath the tall and stalwart pine trees
Our Alma Mater proudly stands;
Over hill and over valleys with full command upon the strand
There is where my mind is nourished
With the wisdom that I need
There is where I reap some knowledge
My heart to strengthen my creed.
***
Hear the murmur of those pine trees
Feel the softness of mountain breeze
If you have some ambition
The right inspiration, you'll find in the Baguio Colleges
(Repeat ***)
